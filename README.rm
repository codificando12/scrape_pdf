<p>Welcome to my Ciappi PDF Scraper, this is a software </br>
developed in Python, you can run it straigh from the console </br>

This sofware was developed for a writer who writes books about China.</p>

<h3>Things to consider</h3>
<ol>
<li> It will save the results in a word file (.docx)</li>
<li> The result will have 100 words, and the keyword will be in the middle</li>
<li>The software takes a while, and it can be stuck, but actually it is running,</br>
    so, don't be impaient</li>
<li>It will not read every pdf and if it is a pdf with design (like magazines), the results will not be </br>
accurate</li>
