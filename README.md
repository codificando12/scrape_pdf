# Ciappi PDF Scraper

Welcome to my Ciappi PDF Scraper, this is software developed in Python. You can run it straight from the console or you can download the **ciappiPDFScraper.exe** file. This software was developed for a writer who writes books about China.

## For Personal Use

You can download the file or the code and use it for free.

### Things to Consider

- It will save the results in a Word file (.docx).
- The result will have 100 words, and the keyword will be in the middle.
- The software takes a while, and it can appear stuck, but actually, it is running, so, don't be impatient.
- It will not read every PDF, and if it is a PDF with design (like magazines), the results will not be accurate.
- It works quite well with books in PDF format.

<h2>For institutions/companies</h2>
